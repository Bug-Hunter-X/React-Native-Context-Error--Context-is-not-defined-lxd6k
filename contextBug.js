This error occurs when you try to use a component that requires a specific context, but that context isn't provided. This usually happens when you're using components that are part of a state management library (like Context API, Redux, or Zustand). For example, if you have a component that expects a user object from a context, but that context is not available in the component tree, you'll see this error.  Another potential source is when using navigation libraries where a component is rendered outside of the navigation container's context.
