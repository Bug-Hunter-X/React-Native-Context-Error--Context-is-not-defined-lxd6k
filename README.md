This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when using context: accessing context values within a component when the context is not properly defined or provided. The `contextBug.js` file shows the erroneous implementation, while `contextBugSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.  This often happens when a component attempts to access context data without being nested within a context provider.  The solution involves ensuring that the component requiring context is nested within a context provider that provides the correct values.
